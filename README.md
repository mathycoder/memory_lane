# Memory Lane

Welcome to Memory Lane!  This Sinatra web application allows you to create shared memories with different lanes of people, adding your own recollections and images to each memory.  

## Installation

Clone this repository using

  $ git clone https://github.com/mathycoder/memory_lane

Then go into the directory

  $ cd memory-lane

From there, execute bundle

  $ bundle install

You'll need to load up the database, so run:

  $ rake db:migrate

Finally, to launch the application, run shotgun and navigate to the index page

## Usage

Start by creating a new user account, and begin by adding your first lane.  You'll need two users
in the program before you can create your first lane.  From there, start adding memories and recollections!
